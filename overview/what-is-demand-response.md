# What is Demand Response?

The goal of **Demand Response** is to **balance the grid** through the **control** of ****energy consuming **devices**. 

We say that a grid is **balanced** when the generation of energy on the grid and the consumption of energy on the grid are equal.

At any **instant,** on **the energy grid** energy generation must equal energy consumption. It's critical to understand that the generation and consumption must **always** be equal. This means that it's not enough for them to even out over the day or the week, but at any instant there must be as much consumption as there is generation, and there must be enough generation to meet the consumption. Of course, in reality there is a tolerance for how close they need to be. In practical terms this means the energy that comes out of the socket in your wall is not always exactly constant even under optimal operational conditions. When energy generation and consumption on a grid are equal, we call the grid **balanced** and all of our electronic devices function as normal. When they are not equal, if there is not enough generation to meet consumption we call that a brown out. When there is too much generation for the level of consumption, electronics that cannot safely dissipate the extra energy will break or wiring may catch fire.

### Who uses our Demand Response Software?

Energy Producers, such as California Edison, PG&E, or ConEd.

Energy Producers create something called a **Demand Response Program**. They then recruit some of their largest customers such as factories and large buildings to sign up for this program. This Demand Response Program allows the Energy Producers to **take active control** of their customer's energy consuming devices for the purpose of balancing the grid and in exchange the customers get paid any time their devices are used in a **Demand Response Event.**

### **Why is this called a Virtual Power Plant?**

Since our only goal is to balance the energy grid, **generating more energy is equivalent to using less energy** and conversely **generating less is equivalent to using more.** It is often much **cheaper and faster** to use less at the last minute that it is to generate more and often times it is not possible to respond fast enough to a need for more generation. Because using less is equivalent to generating more, it can be said that using software to curtail the usage of many distributed assets is like turning another Power Plant on. Since this is not a _real_ power plant, it is refered to as a **Virtual Power Plant**.
