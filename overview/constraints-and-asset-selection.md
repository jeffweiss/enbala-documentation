# Constraints and Asset Selection

Every asset can be associated with constraints which restrict when or how that asset can be controlled by our system.

These constraints include things like:

* Time of day
* Maximum amount of times a device can be turned off and on
* Time between turning an asset off and on
* Minimum level of water in a water heater

Before our bidding process, we have an asset selection process which gathers all of the assets for a Vpp and then filters out any assets based on their constraints.
