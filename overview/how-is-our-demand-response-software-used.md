# How is our Demand Response software used?

Our Demand Response platform has essentially 1 main user flow, everything else is in support of, monitoring, and configuring that user flow.

* Commission and configure Assets
* Group Assets into Sites for Payout
* Group Assets into Virtual Power Plants for Control
* Schedule a Need on a Virtual Power Plant

That is in fact the entire main user flow of our software. Everything else that our software does we either do automatically, like talk to controller portals and calculate the battery model, or is for monitoring that flow.
