# Energy and Power

It is very important to understand what Energy and Power mean and the distinction between the two.

### Power

Is the rate of **transfer of energy** typically measured in **watts** \(W\). We call this the devices charge rate, discharge rate, rated size or simply power.

### Energy

Is the ammount of energy **stored** or how much has **transfered over a given time** and is typically measured in watthours \(Wh\) or joules \(j\) . We call this the devices, storage or simply energy.

### Examples:

if you have a battery with a discharge rate of 2 watts, and it has 2 watthours of storage, it will be half discharged in 30 minutes, and fully discharged in 1 hour.
