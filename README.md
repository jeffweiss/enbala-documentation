# What is a Virtual Power Plant

When people say **Virtual Power Plant** they typically mean one of two things, or both.

### Distributed Energy Resource Management

A grouping of distributed energy **generating** resources, such as wind or solar, together to form a larger, hopefully more stable energy source. This is sometimes called a **Distributed Energy Resource Management** type **Virtual Power Plant.**

### Demand Response

A grouping of energy **consuming** resources, such as water heaters or air conditioning units, for the purposes of controlling them in a **Demand Response Program**.

 At enbala, we offer both types of virtual power plants as products, but as of now \(Dec 2018\) we are only focusing on delivering a **Demand Response** type **Virtual Power Plant**.
